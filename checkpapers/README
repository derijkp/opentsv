checkpapers
===========

We did a scan of 15 journals and GEO for errors in genelists created by
Excel conversion. Papers from 2010 to 2019 (up til May) were downloaded
and checked for supplementary Excel files. The papers in each journal/db
were obtained by either scraping the journal website directly or by
querying pubmed (the resulting xml files used further are available in the
dir source). For PLoS One the papers were limited to papers with genome or
transciptome in the abstract using the query.

The algorithm for detecting gene lists and errors in the gene lists
is the same (but reimplemented) as used in:
Ziemann,M. et al. (2016) Gene name errors are widespread in the scientific
literature. Genome Biology, 17, 177

The results of this analysis as well as the code used to run the analysis
are in this directory.

Result files
------------
A summary file (<source>_siummary.txt) is made per journal, containing the following fields
year: year
papers: number of papers scanned for that year in the given journal
files: number of (Excel) supplementary files
genelist: number of papers with at least one supplementary file containing a gene list
error: number of papers with at least one supplementary file containing a gene list with a conversion error
pcterror: percentage of genelist containing papers with errors

The results per journal are in tab-delimited tables (<source>_result.txt)
containing at least one line per paper with the following fields:
source: journal/db
year: year of publication
id: id identifying paper/db entry
url: url of paper/db entry
suppfile: supplementary file url, empty if no supplementary xls(x) file was found, if more than one -> multiple lines
genelist: 1 if it contains genelist; 0 if xls(x), but no genelist, n for no xls(x) suppl, s for (xls/zip) parse error
geneerrors: number of errors, 0 for xls without errors, n for no xls(x) suppl, s for (xls/zip) parse error



Results per paper
-----------------
The data for all journals is combined, per paper, in result_per_paper.tsv. This has the following fields:
year: year of publication
id: id identifying paper/db entry
source: journal/db
nr_suppfiles: number of supplementary Excel files
nr_genelists: number of supplementary Excel files that contain a gene list
nr_errors: number of errors found in supplementary Excel files of the paper
has_suppfile: 1 if there were supplementary Excel files, 0 if not
has_genelist: 1 if there were gene lists, 0 if not
has_error: 1 if any errors were found, 0 if not

Summary files
-------------
There are also some overview/summary files:
overview.tsv: overview of all per year
overview-geo.tsv: overview per year without GEO
pct_per_paper_overview.tsv: overview per journal

Running the code
----------------
To run the code you need a Linux system with genomecomb installed. The code also requires
wget and ssconvert.
You can (re)run the code using
./checkpapers.tcl
or start a genomecomb shell using "cg sh" and start parts manually by
copy/pasting
Existing result files will be renamed to *.old before making the new result file.
