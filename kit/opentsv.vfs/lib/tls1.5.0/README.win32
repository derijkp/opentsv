This is a win32 build of tls1.5 statically linked to openssl 0.9.7d
and linked with the tcl8.3.3 stubs table.  It was built using MSVC++ 6
and passes all tests in the tls test suite with Tcl 8.3.3 and Tcl
8.4.6.

This version does not work with Tcl 8.2 - see the README.txt file for
information about this.
